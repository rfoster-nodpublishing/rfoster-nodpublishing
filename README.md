- 👋 Hi, I’m Riley Foster. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Nod Publishing in the Digital Native Publishing division, where I'm bringing innovative AI features to life for children's book generation. It's an exciting intersection of technology and storytelling, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.

- 👀 I’m interested in AI, machine learning, digital storytelling, and interactive media. My passion lies in creating engaging, educational, and entertaining content for young readers, leveraging the latest in tech to bring stories to life in ways that captivate and inspire.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about natural language processing and generative AI models. These areas are crucial for my work in creating dynamic and personalized reading experiences. I'm also exploring the world of augmented reality (AR) to see how it can enhance children's books with interactive elements that jump off the page.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of digital publishing. Whether it's developing new algorithms for content generation, designing interactive elements for eBooks, or researching ways to incorporate AI-driven analytics to understand reading patterns, I'm eager to work with like-minded innovators.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Before moving to Seattle and joining Nod Publishing, I worked at Early Riser Publishing, where I was involved in writing software to digitize their historical publications. This experience not only honed my skills in digital preservation but also sparked my interest in how technology can revolutionize the way we interact with literature.

When I'm not coding or buried in the latest tech trends, you can find me navigating the streets of Downtown Seattle on my electric scooter, exploring the vibrant culture of this incredible city. Having moved here from the Tri-Cities area of Washington, I've fallen in love with Seattle's unique blend of natural beauty and urban innovation. It's the perfect backdrop for dreaming up the next big thing in digital publishing.
